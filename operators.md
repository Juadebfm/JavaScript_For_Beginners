1. Compare the slope of above two questions.
1. Calculate the value of y (y = x<sup>2</sup> + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is 0.
1. Writ a script that prompt a user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?

   Your first name, Asabeneh is longer than your family name, Yetayeh
   ```

1. Declare two variables _myAge_ and _yourAge_ and assign them initial values and myAge and yourAge.

   ```js
   let myAge = 250;
