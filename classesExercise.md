# Exercises

## Exercises Level 1

1. Create an Animal class. The class will have name, age, color, legs properties and create different methods
2. Create a Dog and Cat child class from the Animal Class.

## Exercises Level 2

1. Override the method you create in Animal class

### Exercises Level 3

1. Let's try to develop a program which calculate measure of central tendency of a sample(mean, median, mode) and measure of variability(range, variance, standard deviation). In addition to those measures find the min, max, count, percentile, and frequency distribution of the sample. You can create a class called Statistics and create all the functions which do statistical calculations as method for the Statistics class. Check the output below.

```JS
ages = [31, 26, 34, 37, 27, 26, 32, 32, 26, 27, 27, 24, 32, 33, 27, 25, 26, 38, 37, 31, 34, 24, 33, 29, 26]

console.log('Count:', statistics.count()) // 25
console.log('Sum: ', statistics.sum()) // 744
console.log('Min: ', statistics.min()) // 24
console.log('Max: ', statistics.max()) // 38
console.log('Range: ', statistics.range() // 14
console.log('Mean: ', statistics.mean()) // 30
console.log('Median: ',statistics.median()) // 29
console.log('Mode: ', statistics.mode()) // {'mode': 26, 'count': 5}
console.log('Variance: ',statistics.var()) // 17.5
console.log('Standard Deviation: ', statistics.std()) // 4.2
console.log('Variance: ',statistics.var()) // 17.5
console.log('Frequency Distribution: ',statistics.freqDist()) // [(20.0, 26), (16.0, 27), (12.0, 32), (8.0, 37), (8.0, 34), (8.0, 33), (8.0, 31), (8.0, 24), (4.0, 38), (4.0, 29), (4.0, 25)]
```

```sh
// you output should look like this
console.log(statistics.describe())
Count: 25
Sum:  744
Min:  24
Max:  38
Range:  14
Mean:  30
Median:  29
Mode:  (26, 5)
Variance:  17.5
Standard Deviation:  4.2
Frequency Distribution: [(20.0, 26), (16.0, 27), (12.0, 32), (8.0, 37), (8.0, 34), (8.0, 33), (8.0, 31), (8.0, 24), (4.0, 38), (4.0, 29), (4.0, 25)]
```

1. Create a class called PersonAccount. It has firstname, lastname, incomes, expenses properties and it has totalIncome, totalExpense, accountInfo,addIncome, addExpense and accountBalance methods. Incomes is a set of incomes and its description and expenses is also a set of expenses and its description.
