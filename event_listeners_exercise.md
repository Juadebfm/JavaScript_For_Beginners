## Exercise: Level 1

1. Generating numbers and marking evens, odds and prime numbers with three different colors.

- So in the code: ![Numbers Generator](./test.js) i have already generated a code that solves the major problem, what you will do now is refactor the code so that even numbers will have a background of _green_, odd numbers will have a background of _red_, prime numbers will have a background of _azure-blue_ with text that looks great against these bacgrounds. Also for everytime the validation text comes up, the input border should change to red.

1. Generating the keyboard code using even listener. The image below.
